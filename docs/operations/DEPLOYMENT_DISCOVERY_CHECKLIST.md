## Production Supabase feature release checklist

Use this checklist before marking the community, topic suggestions, and candidate review features as production-ready. These checks must be performed against the actual deployed production URL, not only against local development.

### 1. Vercel / deployment environment variables

Confirm all required runtime secrets are configured in the production deployment environment:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `ADMIN_SECRET`
- `CONTRIBUTOR_SALT`

Notes:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are required for public Supabase reads and browser-safe client paths.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is required only on trusted server-side routes; never expose it to client code.
- `ADMIN_SECRET` gates admin APIs and admin-only UI actions.
- `CONTRIBUTOR_SALT` is required so public submissions store only `contributor_hash` and never raw IP addresses.

### 2. Supabase SQL Editor migrations

In the Supabase SQL Editor, confirm these migrations have been applied to the production database, in dependency order where applicable:

- `supabase/migrations/20260622_topic_candidates.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20260623_topic_candidates_consensus.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20260624_community_and_stats.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20260625_topic_suggestions.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20260625_post_moderation.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20260625_lock_rls.sql`

Minimum table/policy smoke checks after migration:

- `topic_candidates` exists and supports public topic suggestions plus admin review operations.
- `community_posts` exists with moderation-aware public insert/select behavior.
- `document_stats` exists for view and AI citation counters.
- RLS remains enabled; public read is not allowed for edits, reports, or hallucination reports.

### 3. Production URL manual route checks

After deployment, open each route once on the actual production URL and confirm it renders or responds as expected:

- `/community` — community page loads, post list/form renders, and public submit path does not expose raw IPs.
- `/suggest-topic` — topic suggestion form loads and can submit a pending candidate.
- `/admin/posts` — admin password flow loads; authenticated admin can review/manage posts.
- `/admin/candidates` — admin password flow loads; authenticated admin can review topic candidates.
- `/api/posts` — public posts API responds without leaking server secrets or unpublished moderation data.

Record the production URL, date/time, checker, and result before closing the release.

## Privacy and scope checks

- Do not store raw IP addresses.
- Store `contributor_hash` only for public submissions.
- Do not expose public read access for edits, reports, or hallucination_reports.
- Do not require login for public submissions.
- Do not add payment, user accounts, or complex auth in the MVP.
- Do not invent venue facts; unknown facts remain “확인 필요” with low confidence.

### Route Verification (all 200)
- `/` ✅
- `/ko/wiki/myungdong-laluce-parking` ✅
- `/api/documents/myungdong-laluce-parking` ✅
- `/raw/myungdong-laluce-parking.md` ✅
- `/report/myungdong-laluce-parking` ✅
- `/hallucination/myungdong-laluce-parking` ✅
- `/diagnostics/myungdong-laluce-parking` ✅
- `/admin/review` ✅
- `/admin/new-entity` ✅
- `/admin/new-document` ✅
- `/admin/import` ✅
- `/sitemap.xml` ✅
- `/robots.txt` ✅

### Build Status
- `npm run lint`: pass ✅
- `npm run build`: pass ✅ (TypeScript + Next.js)
- Vercel production deployment: green ✅

### Known Limitations (by design)
- No Supabase runtime integration — submissions are stubs only
- No DB persistence — all data is static seed
- Admin tools are UI stubs only
- App Router root `<html lang>` is emitted from the global root layout and remains the configured default locale (`en`) for now. Locale routes keep static-first content scoped with an inner `<div lang dir>`, plus locale-specific `hreflang`, `x-default`, Open Graph locale, and content-language metadata. Accessibility backlog: evaluate a multi-root route-group structure or another Next-supported approach that lets `/[locale]` routes emit path-specific root `<html lang>` without breaking non-locale routes or static-first rendering.
